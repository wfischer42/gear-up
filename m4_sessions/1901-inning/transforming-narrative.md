# Session Outline: Include the flow of the session and the time for each section.

Jen: 
5 minute sorting hat.
Small groups: 10 minutes - Introductions/Why we decided to provide this Gearup.
- What are fixed & growth mindsets?
- Are they mutually exclusive? Independent?
- Can you feel fixed mindset while practicing growth mindset?
- Is growth mindset the same as "positive thinking"?

----

William:
Small Groups: 5 Minutes - Paper puzzle challenge. Anyone who has done it before will be asked to refrain from participating and just watch the rest of the group. The idea here is not to "catch" people who are experiencing fixed mindsets, but rather allow everyone to have a shared experience of fixed mindsets and recognize how they behave when they feel challenged.

Small Groups: 5 Minutes - Discuss the challenge.
    -- "What were you feeling during the challenge?"
    -- "What were some behaviors that you experienced during the challenge?"
    -- Having student journal their internal narrative during this challenge.
    -- How can you identify fixed mindset in yourself?
    -- How can you recognize it in others? (without making assumptions)

Large Groups: 5 Minute group discussion.

5 minute - Pom Break

-----

Tim:
Small Groups: 7 minutes - Students will identify an area that they are in a fixed mindset. Students will think of a time they they felt a fixed mindset, whether it was during Turing or before. Are there areas in the future where you feel that you're feeling fixed?

Large Group: 3 minutes - Discuss. Make a list of "symptoms" of fixed mindset.

8 minutes - Angelela DuckWorth Grit: The Power of Perseverence and Passion.

-----

Quin:
Small Groups: 10 minutes - Discuss how to move out of growth mindset. How do you re-frame your narrative. 
Large Group: 5 minutes - Large group discussion


==== END OF SECTION TO UPDATE ====

## New Ideas

Introduce fixed and growth mindsets and then give students scenarios and ask them to decide if each is a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.

Assign groups based on mixing together introverts and extroverts. Use cards that are color coded by how introverted or extroverted the students are then sort them into piles for each of us to run as small groups with a mixture of each color.

Groups of 4 for small discussions and regroup to share small group ideas.

Discuss techniques for moving out of a fixed mindset before infographic exercise.

Use whiteboard to make a list of symptoms of fixed mindset and a list of techniques for moving towards a growth mindset.

Instead of a coding challenge do a paper puzzle. - Will
